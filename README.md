# Data Visualization Infographic

Creating an infographic to showcase the data visualization skills I have learned this month

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have always loved seeing beautiful infographics that convey information in interesting
and unique ways. I decided that as a sort of "final project" for my introduction to 
data visualization I would make an infographic that would serve as a portfolio of some
of the work I completed this month.

While this does not include all of the visualizations I have generated (specifically it does
not include any animations) and does not include the work produced for my clients, it does
include a good showcase of the breadth of skills I have been using over the past few months.
